# Testing flask for group project


Please use the python file onetime.py before starting, this is to clear the database before testing

then run
`python app.py`
in a venv, use something similar to this: works different for Windows / MacOs / Linux
```
mkdir survey_platform
cd survey_platform
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Or just make a venv in VScode (much easier)

flask run / run flask does not work on my machine for some reason (Maybe conflicting terminals etc)

## NOTE THIS IS NOT THE GITHUB REPO THAT WE WILL BE DOING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT ON, I JUST WANTED TO PLAY AROUND WITH FLASK
